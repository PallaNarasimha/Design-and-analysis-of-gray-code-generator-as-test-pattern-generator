# Design-and-analysis-of-gray-code-generator-as-test-pattern-generator

This project describes what is gray code, different types of it, applications of gray code and different properties of it. It also tells about the difference between binary and gray, and advantages of gray over binary, and how the properties like static power, dynamic power, junction temperature, and utilization will vary if we compare the lower-bit gray to the higher-bit ones.

We have written the entire code in Verilog. The simulation, RTL(Register Transfer Level) analysis, synthesis, and implementation of the entire design are done using the Vivado software tool.
