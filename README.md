# Design-and-analysis-of-gray-code-generator-as-test-pattern-generator

In this project, we have generated the sequence of the different bit Gray code and compared the different properties of the lower-bit ones to the higher-bit ones. We have written the entire code in Verilog. The simulation, synthesis, and implementation of the design are done using the Vivado software tool.
